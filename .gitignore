# Ignore Python cache and virtual environments
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
venv/

.env
.venv/ # Common virtual environment folder name

# Ignore Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Ignore data files (especially raw and large processed ones)
# This will ignore EVERYTHING inside data/raw and data/processed
data/raw/
data/processed/
# If you had very small, essential CSVs in data/processed you *wanted* to track,
# you could add an exception like:
# !data/processed/my_small_essential_metadata.csv
# But for now, ignoring all of data/raw and data/processed is safest.

# Ignore any downloaded index.html files
index.html
data/index.html # If index.html was in the data folder

# macOS specific
.DS_Store

# IDE-specific folders (example for VS Code)
.vscode/
